Centralize resources and ensure documentation, policies, templates, and communication tools are all accessible from one place  
Enables monitoring of logging of administrative actions, and workflow-based approval chains for changing access permissions, supporting both transparency and compliance

A data dictionary can significantly enhance data quality by providing a consistent framework for data entry, storage, and usage. By clearly defining data elements, the dictionary helps to prevent inconsistencies and errors that can arise from misinterpretation or misuse of data

a data dictionary may be:  
As simple as a spreadsheet with well-designed headers for each field,  
More complex, with enumerated values, validation rules, and extensive metadata,  
Or a searchable, interactive web catalog for larger organizations.

**A (Non-exhaustive) List of Notes Options that Can Be Versioned**

| Tool | Pros | Cons | Cost | Security Focus | Git Sync | Use Cases |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) | Highly customizable; Markdown-based; excellent backlinking; optional Git sync | No native sync without plugins; Git setup required manually | Free; optional paid plugins or Obsidian Sync | Local-first; Git versioning; use disk encryption or GitHub SSH for security | Manual Git sync via GitHub Desktop or CLI | Great for shared wikis, SOPs, and campaign data logs with strong folder structure |
| [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) | Structured outlines; backlinks and journaling; built-in Git support | Steeper learning curve for outlining; fewer plugins than Obsidian | Free; open source | Local storage; Git sync with history; self-hosting possible | Built-in Git sync integration; automatic commit/push options | Ideal for daily tracking, strategy logs, or breaking down recurring workflows |
| [Trilium](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium) | Powerful tree structure; note cloning, scripting, and visual graph view; multilingual UI support | Clunky UI; requires configuration; limited theming and accessibility options | Free; self-host or run locally | Self-host or local-first; can be isolated from the web; disk encryption recommended | Manual Git integration with self-hosting or scripts | Best for teams who want structured internal knowledge bases with scripting options |
| [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) | Markdown support; flexible syncing options; tagging and notebook structure; available in multiple languages | Basic interface; limited real-time collaboration; search and navigation can be clunky | Free; optional donations and optional fee-based cloud workspaces | End to end encryption; syncs via secure backends | Can sync to Git via third-party backends or local scripts | Good for teams seeking a lightweight Git-enabled solution with multilingual accessibility |
| [Dendron (VS Code Extension)](https://www.dendron.so/) | Built into VS Code; powerful hierarchy system; native Git integration; supports multi-language coding and keyboard shortcuts | Requires familiarity with VS Code; steeper learning curve for non-technical users | Free; open source | Local file storage with Git; versioned and developer-friendly | Native Git integration in VS Code; easy commits, branches, and pushes | Excellent for technically inclined teams building highly structured, Git-based documentation |
